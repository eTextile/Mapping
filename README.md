# Mapping Toolkit for the eTextile-Synthesizer
## Bring audio functionality to the textile graphic patterns

This **Mapping Toolkit** is made to create the mapping between the textile graphic patterns and the builtin audio-synthesizer or any external MIDI device. It offers a library of geometric shapes which are tactile input controls like sliders, switches, etc. Starting from the textile design surface made on top of the matrix sensor, this web application is using the sensor values to define and adjust the sensing functionalities in relation with the visual patterns.

## Web Application

    https://mapping.etextile.org/

## Functionalities
- Create your custom textile graphic user interface.
- Select the MIDI audio effects you want to mapp to your textile graphic user interface.
- Upload your created UI and MIDI parameters to the eTextile-Synthesizer.
- If you are satisfied, save your mapping to the eTextile-Synthesizer permanent memory.
